## Principle 2 – Source of personal information.
###     -Personal information should be collected directly from the person it is about. The best source of information about a person is usually the person themselves.

### A. Does a person need to be aware about the collecting of information?

- [ ] Collecting information from the person concerned means they know what is going on and have some control over their information.

### B. Is it always be possible to collect information directly from the person concerned?

- [ ] It won’t always be possible to collect information directly from the person concerned, so organisations can collect it from other people in certain situations. For instance; if the person concerned authorises collection from someone else, if it’s necessary to uphold or enforce the law, if the information is collected from a publicly available source, if collecting information from the person directly would undermine the purpose of collection.

## Principle 5 - Storage and security of personal information.
###     - The organisations must ensure there are safeguards in place that are reasonable in the circumstances to prevent loss, misuse or disclosure of personal information.

### A. What security measures are appropriate?

- [ ] Agencies have to take reasonable steps to make sure the information they hold is kept safe and secure. This includes making sure it is protected from loss, accidental or unauthorised disclosure, access, use or modification or any other misuse.
- [ ] There are a number of different aspects to consider, including physical security, electronic security, operational security, security during transmission and during destruction.

### B. How can I physically secure personal information?

- [ ] Physical security is an important part of protecting personal information, whether it’s in a paper file or a on device such as a laptop, smartphone, tablet, USB stick or portable hard drive.
- [ ] Lock sensitive files and devices in secure cabinets at the end of each day, and make sure the last person to leave locks the workspace. If staff need to take files or devices out of the office, make sure they don’t leave them unattended in public places or visible in homes or parked cars.
- [ ] You can also put measures in place to minimise the damage if a device goes missing. If you can access personal information through a device, it should have a strong password or encryption. Delete personal information from a device if you no longer need it – if it’s not on the device, it’s not at risk.
